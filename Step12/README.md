# Step 12: Game page

## Goal

Our quiz game can display the home page, the list of categories, the result page, but we can't even display questions! Let's do that!

![Screenshot of the game page](../Utils/images/step12.png)

Here is the HTML code you need to have:

```html
<div>
    <h2 class="question">Question here</h2>
    <ul class="answers">
        <li><a class="btn btn-primary">Answer 1</a></li>
        <li><a class="btn btn-primary">Answer 2</a></li>
        <li><a class="btn btn-primary">Answer 3</a></li>
        <li><a class="btn btn-primary">Answer 4</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

Everything is static for now, we will add the logic in the next steps. 
 

## Let's start!

[See the result of your code](./GamePage.elm) (don't forget to refresh to see changes)

Once the tests are passing, you can go to the [next step](../Step13).
