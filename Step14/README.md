# Step 14: Integrate the Game page

## Goal

The Game page only display the first question for now, but before going further into the game logic, let's add it to what we've done before!

In this step, we are gonna integrate this new page inside our navigation. 

To ease your life, the solution of the previous step has been copied inside a *GamePage.elm* file next to the main file.

Be careful where you will store the `Game` object inside your model, it should only be available on the game page!

**/!\ WARNING /!\** There are two Elm files ; you should only modify the `Main.elm` file. However you can copy/paste or import elements from the other file.

## Let's start!

[See the result of your code](./Main.elm) (don't forget to refresh to see changes)

Once the tests are passing, you can go to the [next step](../Step15).
